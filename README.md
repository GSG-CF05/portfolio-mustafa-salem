## Why did I create this webpage?

This webpage is my portfolio, which is done due to the first project assignment of the Coding Foundation Course which is implemented by the amazing Code Academy at GazaSkyGeeks.

## About this portfolio:-

This site is made of three section:

- _About Me_ section.
- _My Skills_ section.
- _My Contacts_ Section.
  And also contains a header and a footer.

### About Me section.

In this section I've made a short bio about me and a flip picture which will flip when you hover over it and hold.

### My Skills section.

In this section I've listed the skills that I obtain with ratios and a draw refers to each ratio.

### My Contacts section.

In this section I've put my **_Business Email_** and my **_Twitter Account_** and my **_Discord Profile_** with a short paragraph for each of them.

### Header and Footer.

##### Header:

In the header I used a logo picture and navigation bar with an internal link to each section with its title.

##### Footer:

In the footer I used The copyrights sentence, my business email, and my social media platforms.
